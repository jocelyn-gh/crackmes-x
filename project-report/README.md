The purpose of this paper is to try and clearly explain what reverse engineering is and
how software programs can be exploited, and their relationship. It will be using visual aids of
screenshots of various programs being used to reverse engineer and explain them. Programs I
have developed will be used to show case various types of exploits.


The goal of this project is to give an in-depth analysis on how to read a program thatâ€™s broken
down in operational codes, that can be read in as assembly level language. To map out the
functions, logic, etc. of the program. To spot and exploit different type of vulnerability, and how
to patch it. This will be done on programs I have created and on a real program if there is time.
